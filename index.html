  <p>Crong was officially put into the famous Pororo. He was put in on Season 1 episode 3. He is a green dinosaur that was hatched from an egg by Pororo. He was about to be cooked for food by Pororo, until the egg rolled away and started to crack. When the egg opened, Crong jumped out and greeted Pororo with a hug. This is the story of how they became best friends.
